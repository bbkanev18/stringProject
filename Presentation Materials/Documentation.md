1. Who we are
2. What the is project about
3. How we made the project
4. How the code works

### Read the ReadMe for instructions on how to start the program

## 1. Who we are

We are students from an IT school in Bulgaria.
* Boris Kanev(9A) - Developer, Team Manager
* Martin Sevov(9V) - Developer

## 2. What the project is about

This is a school project. We had to use header files and strings to make a program that utilises.

## 3. How we made the project

We used Visual Studio 2019 and Github to make and work on the project. It was made in C++ and is ~1500 lines long. It took us ~1 week to go from start to finish. We desided to split it up into a few header files.

## 4. How the code works


We have 3 games

1. Fizz Buzz
2. Hang Man
3. Tick Tack Toe
